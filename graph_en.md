When dealing with small datasets, the naive Dijkstra algorithm might be faster than the heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm, mainly due to the following reasons:

1. **Constant Factors**: The heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm uses a priority queue to store the nodes to be visited and their distances. Although the average time complexity of insertion and deletion operations in a priority queue is O(log n), the constant factors (i.e., the ratio of actual running time to input size) might make the operations of the priority queue slower than those of simple arrays or vectors in small datasets.

2. **Initialization and Destruction of Data Structures**: Using a priority queue requires additional time to initialize and destroy the data structure. For small datasets, this extra time might exceed the performance improvement brought by the priority queue.

3. **Cache Effect**: For small datasets, the naive Dijkstra algorithm might utilize the CPU cache better. When the dataset is small, the entire graph might fit entirely within the CPU cache, thereby reducing memory access latency. The priority queue might cause cache misses due to frequent memory allocation and deallocation, increasing the running time.

4. **Compiler Optimization**: Compilers might perform more optimizations for operations on small datasets, such as loop unrolling, inlining functions, etc. These optimizations might make the naive algorithm run faster on small datasets.

5. **Simplicity of the Algorithm**: The naive Dijkstra algorithm is usually simpler and easier for the compiler to optimize. For small datasets, this simplicity might bring a performance advantage.

In summary, when the dataset is small, the naive Dijkstra algorithm might be faster than the heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm due to the above reasons. However, as the dataset grows, the heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm generally outperforms the naive algorithm, as its time complexity is O((V+E) log V), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges, while the time complexity of the naive algorithm is O(V^2).
